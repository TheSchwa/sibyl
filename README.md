# sibyl
an XMPP bot for controlling XBMC/Kodi

## Intro
This is my personal XMPP bot made mostly for controlling XBMC on my Raspberry Pi. I find the `videos`, `seek`, `info`, `bookmark`, and `resume` commands to be very handy. This is tested on RaspBMC and OSMC, but should work on anything if you resolve the dependencies and setup python correctly. Sibyl does not support windows, although you could probably get it working via cygwin. The code is in the `sibylbot.py` as a library, and an example script `sibyl.py` is shown for running the bot. For command explanations and other info check out [the wiki][1]. Currently sibyl is built assuming the bot is running on the same device that is running XBMC (e.g. an RPi).

## Dependencies
You'll need the following installed in order to use sibyl:
 - [xmpppy][10] - XMPP python API - `git clone https://github.com/normanr/xmpppy.git`
 - [requests][3] - HTTP request and wrapper library - `pip install requests`
 - [smbc][4] - python samba bindings - `pip install pysmbc`
 - [lxml][9] - xml and html parsing - `pip install lxml`
 - [dns][11] - required for requests - `pip install dnspython`
 - [JSON-RPC][6] - you have to enable the web server in XBMC

The following are optional but not having them may render some commands broken:
 - [cec-client][5] - HDMI CEC client for tv commands

One-liner for Ubuntu/Debian:
 - `sudo apt install python-xmpp python-requests python-smbc python-lxml python-dnspython`

## Setup
Setup is very easy, all you really have to do is make a config file.

 1. Install dependencies (see above)
 2. Copy `sibyl.conf.default` to `sibyl.conf` and edit the new file
 3. Set the required options `username` and `password`
 4. If you want the bot to join a room set `rooms` in the `JabberBot` section
 5. If starting Sibyl from the command line, add its parent directory to your `PYTHONPATH`
 6. Start the bot with `python run.py`

Here is the minimum config file (excluding `rooms` which is optional):

```
username = sibyl@server.com
password = wordpass
rooms = room@conference.server.com
```

## JabberBot
By default sibyl is setup to join an XMPP MUC (i.e. group chat) but you can change that if you want. Refer to the [examples directory][7] for JabberBot. Adding additional commands is easy as well. Simply define a new method inside the `SibylBot` class and preface it with `@botcmd` to register the command.

Note that there is currently a bug in JabberBot. It does not correctly ignore message from itself when in a MUC. This is fixed naievly in sibyl by simply searching for `NICKNAME` in the from field of XMPP replies. Therefore, as currently implemented, any user whose name contains sibyl's `NICKNAME` will be ignored.

## XBMC/Kodi
Sibyl interfaces with XBMC using its JSON-RPC web interface. In order to use it, you must enable the web server in XBMC (see the link in the Dependencies section). Therefore, for these commands, the bot does not actually have to be running on the Pi. It just needs to be able to reach the Pi's HTTP interface..

## CEC
Sibyl uses the `cec-client` bash script to give commands over HDMI-CEC to an attached TV. This should be installed on most Pi distros by default. If not, debian derivatives can install with `sudo apt-get install cec-client`. For the CEC commands to work, the bot must be running on the Pi itself. Also note that `cec-client` may not be found depending on your environment. On my Pi it's located at `/home/pi/.xbmc-current/xbmc-bin/bin/cec-client`.

## Search Directories
You can add folders to `VIDEODIRS` and `AUDIODIRS` in order to search them using the `search`, `audio`, `audios`, `video`, and `videos` commands. You can add the following as list items:
  - local directory, example: `'/media/flashdrive/videos'`
  - samba share, example: `{'server':'THESCHWA','share':'videos','username':'user','password':'pass'}`

For samba shares not protected by a passowrd, you can exclude the `'username'` and `'password'` keys in the above example.

Also be aware that root cannot read `sshfs` mounts from other users by default. If this is a problem with your setup (e.g. I run sibyl as `root` via the init script, but the `sshfs` mount requires the `pi` user's pubkey), you have to specify `sshfs -o allow_root ...` when you mount the share as a non-root user.

## Init Script
For Debian and derivates I include an init script, `sibyl.init` and the actual execution script `sibyl`. Note that if you want to use these you may have to change the `DAEMON` variable in `sibyl.init`. In my setup, `sibyl.init` is in `/etc/init.d/`, `sibyl` is in `/home/pi/bin`, and `sibyl.py` is in `/home/pi/bin`. You will likely have to rename `sibyl.init` to `sibyl` for compliance with Debian's init system.

## Logging
By default, sibyl logs to `/var/log/sibyl.log`. To enable debug logging, simply uncomment the debug line in `sibyl.py`. This log file requires sibyl be run as root. If that is undesirable, you can specify a different log file when initializing the bot with the `log_file` kwarg.

## Known Bugs
 - Very large media libraries may cause smaller devices like the Pi to run out of RAM.
